Ever wanted to passively watch prs/issues in a repo without subscribing to every event?

Yup me too.

This gives you an rss feed. Ideally one entry when it opens.

--------------------------------------------

Usage
  gh-issues-to-rss --server  # in your server
  http://<url>/<org>/<repo>  # use this in your feed reader

Example
  nvim-treesitter/nvim-tree [pr]: Adds fish shell textobjects
  nvim-treesitter/nvim-tree [pr]: Add Elixir textobjects
  meain/dotfiles            [issue]: Just a thought
  meain/dotfiles            [issue]: Screenshots
  nvim-treesitter/nvim-tree [issue]: Question: is it expected that inner function objects include braces?

--------------------------------------------

TODO
- Enable filters to get only select data (query files in url)
  - When new issue opens
  - When new pr opens
  - When issue closes
  - When pr closes
