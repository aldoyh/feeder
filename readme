Ever wanted to passively watch prs/issues in a repo without subscribing to every event?

Yup, me too.

This gives you an rss feed. One entry when it opens and one when it closes.
That too, filterable. I know!

--------------------------------------------

> Demo server: https://gh-issues-to-rss.fly.dev
> Example: https://gh-issues-to-rss.fly.dev/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter

Usage
  gh-issues-to-rss --server  # in your server
  http://<url>/<org>/<repo>  # use this in your feed reader

Example
  nvim-treesitter/nvim-tree [pr-open]: Adds fish shell textobjects
  nvim-treesitter/nvim-tree [pr-close]: Add Elixir textobjects
  meain/dotfiles            [issue-close]: Just a thought
  meain/dotfiles            [issue-close]: Screenshots
  nvim-treesitter/nvim-tree [issue-open]: Question: is it expected that inner function objects include braces?

You can pass in extra arg in the url to filter things down:

- `m`: specify modes
  - ic: issue-closed
  - io: issue-open
  - pc: pr-closed
  - po: pr-open
  > Eg: http://<url>/<org>/<repo>?m=io&m=po  # just open issues and prs
- `l`: speify label
  > Eg: http://<url>/<org>/<repo>?l=good-first-issue  # just issus/prs labeled good-first-issue
- `u`: specify user
  > Eg: http://<url>/<org>/<repo>?u=meain  # just issus/prs opened by meain
- `nu`: specify user to exclude
  > Eg: http://<url>/<org>/<repo>?nu=meain  # just issus/prs not opened by meain

All filters can be used multiple times. Positive filters are ANDed
together, negative filters are ORed together.

Caveats
- Github rate limits to 60 requests per hour
- We invalidate internal cache only every 12 hours
